Welcome, 

This repo is dedicated to the Kaggle competition about Titanic survival, you can find the report on pdf or html on [this link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yobid/titanic_kaggle/blob/gh-branch/model.html).

We used data analysis to compute and clean our original dataset, and then we used a Random Forest prediction model, which showed the best accuracy.
